# PafiasEssentials


Basically my own minecraft Essentials or something like that

If you somehow find this, and want to use it, feel free to.

just don't steal my code :'(
#
JAR file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Pafias/PafiasEssentials/releases/latest/download/PafiasEssentials-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
#
Written in Paper API 1.16

Tested and compatible with (paper) versions **1.11** & **1.16**

Not tested but has NMS compatibility for (paper) versions **1.8** & **1.12**

If you didn't understand anything of the past 3 lines: you can use this plugin on versions **1.11**, **1.12** and **1.16**, and maybe on **1.8** (but who the f still uses 1.8 anyway)
#
Written in Java 8 so it's compatible with the versions between 1.8 and 1.16 ; Probably won't work on newer java versions.

Versions above 1.16 don't support java 8 anymore, but i want my plugin to support it, so that's why this plugin doesn't work on versions newer than 1.16 :s
